This repo contains code and text for
[Probabilistically Bounded Staleness for Practical Partial
Quorums](http://pbs.cs.berkeley.edu/pbs-vldb2012.pdf) in VLDB 2012.

We do not recommend the use of this code and suggest using the PBS
code [committed to Cassandra
trunk](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/0b94b191d803f2a59e39c0e14fca45f5fb2ceb65)
instead. You can see our old Cassandra changes
[here](https://github.com/shivaram/pbs-paper-cassandra-historical). That
said, all other material is in the `archived` branch.

Please contact pbailis@cs.berkeley.edu with any questions or concerns.
